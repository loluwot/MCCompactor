Tool that compacts modded minecraft processes into a specified 3D space. Reads in a directed graph that describes the process. Assumes all nodes in graph are machines and also require a connection to power, and that power is provided through one node inside the space (might be an inefficient assumption). Forces machines that require external input/output onto the border. 

Note: very very very slow
